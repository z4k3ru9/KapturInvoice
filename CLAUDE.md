# KapturInvoice

TALL-stack (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel 13, Livewire 4) billing/invoicing
platform replacing a legacy InvoiceNinja v4 install, with Filament 5 as the
multi-tenant admin/billing dashboard. Full background:
- [`docs/invoiceninja-v4-schema-reference.md`](docs/invoiceninja-v4-schema-reference.md) — legacy schema this was designed against + import plan.
- [`docs/filament-admin-layout-design.md`](docs/filament-admin-layout-design.md) — admin panel nav/page layout, what's built vs. still a gap (✅/⚠️ markers).
- [`README.md`](README.md) — stack table, architecture, setup.

Read this file first on every session — it exists so setup/login/seed
facts don't need to be re-derived by grepping migrations and seeders each
time.

## Local setup (already done in most sandboxes — verify, don't redo blindly)

```sh
composer install && npm install
cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate   # skip if .env exists
touch database/database.sqlite                      # skip if it exists
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed                    # safe to re-run; drops+recreates
npm run build                                       # or `npm run dev`
php artisan serve                                    # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Or just `composer setup` (runs the same steps via the composer script).

## Login / seeded data (from `database/seeders/`)

- **Admin panel:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` — login as
  **`test@example.com` / `password`** (Laravel's stock `UserFactory`
  default — `Hash::make('password')`, not a random string). This user has
  `is_super_admin = true` and is attached to both seeded companies as
  `owner`.
- **Two seeded companies** (`CompanySeeder`, placeholders — rename once
  the real two entities are known): `Entity One` (`entity-one.test`,
  prefixes `E1-`/`Q1-`/`C1-`) and `Entity Two` (`entity-two.test`,
  prefixes `E2-`/`Q2-`/`C2-`). Switch between them via the tenant menu once
  logged in, or jump straight to `/admin/entity-one`/`/admin/entity-two`.
- **Public homepage** (`/`, plain Livewire, outside the Filament panel) is
  resolved by the request's `Host` header, not URL path — to preview a
  specific entity locally without editing `/etc/hosts`, either send a
  `Host` header (`curl -H "Host: entity-one.test" http://127.0.0.1:8000/`)
  or, for a real browser/Playwright session, launch Chromium with
  `--host-resolver-rules="MAP entity-one.test 127.0.0.1,MAP entity-two.test 127.0.0.1"`
  and navigate to `http://entity-one.test:8000/` directly — Chromium
  refuses to let you set the `Host` header itself via
  `setExtraHTTPHeaders`. An unmatched host falls back to the first
  company in local/testing envs.
- Currencies/countries are seeded (`CurrencySeeder`/`CountrySeeder`) as
  real lookup tables, not re-derived from the legacy dump.

## Conventions this codebase already commits to (don't relitigate)

- **Filament v5 API**, not v3/v4 — forms use `Filament\Schemas\Schema`
  (not `Filament\Forms\Form`); layout components (`Section`, `Grid`) live
  in `Filament\Schemas\Components\*`; input components stay in
  `Filament\Forms\Components\*`.
- **`#[Fillable([...])]` PHP attribute** on every model, not a classic
  `$fillable` property. When adding a field to a form, add it here too —
  a missed column here silently no-ops the field (this has bitten every
  new resource so far).
- **`App\Models\Concerns\BelongsToCompany`** trait on every directly
  tenant-owned model — auto-scopes queries/`Select::relationship()`
  pickers and auto-fills `company_id` on create. Models scoped only
  *indirectly* (`Invitation` via its invoice, `User` via the
  `company_user` pivot) instead set `protected static bool
  $isScopedToTenant = false;` on their Resource and apply an explicit
  `whereHas()` scope in `getEloquentQuery()`.
- **Normalized tax pivots** (`invoice_item_taxes`, `expense_taxes`) — not
  the legacy inline `tax_name1/rate1` + `tax_name2/rate2` columns.
  `tax_rate_ids` on the relevant forms is a **virtual field**, synced via
  `InvoiceTotalsCalculator`/`ExpenseTotalsCalculator` in the
  Create/Edit page or relation-manager action hooks — see
  `ItemsRelationManager` for the canonical pattern.
- **`legacy_*_id` column** on every importable table, for tracing rows
  back to the source InvoiceNinja dump.
- Full Filament resource file layout per resource: `{Name}Resource.php`,
  `Schemas/{Name}Form.php`, `Schemas/{Name}Infolist.php`,
  `Tables/{Name}Table.php`, `Pages/{Create,Edit,List,View}{Name}.php` —
  follow this shape for any new resource rather than inventing a new one.
- Settings that are one row per tenant (`company_settings`,
  `Company` itself) are Filament **Pages**
  (`App\Filament\Pages\Settings\Concerns\InteractsWithSettingsRecord`),
  never Resources.

## Verify before pushing

```sh
php artisan test      # 28 tests as of the last scaffolding pass
vendor/bin/pint       # auto-fixes style; run before every commit
```
